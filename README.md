Interactive Math Quiz Game (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
Developed a dynamic web-based math game where players solve timed multiplication problems to achieve high scores. Key features include:

Core Gameplay: Randomized arithmetic questions (e.g., "5x7") with four answer choices, ensuring varied challenges.

Score & Timer System: Implemented a 60-second countdown, real-time scoring, and persistent high-score tracking using browser cookies.

UI/UX Design: Built a polished interface with CSS gradients, hover/click animations, and visual feedback (correct/wrong indicators).

Responsive Logic: Utilized JavaScript for dynamic question generation, answer validation, and game state management (start/reset).

Optimization: Cross-browser compatibility with vendor prefixes for CSS transitions and shadows.

Technologies: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Animations), JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Cookies).

Highlight: Demonstrated full-stack frontend skills by integrating interactive logic, state persistence, and user-centric design. Emphasized problem-solving in real-time updates and game flow.
